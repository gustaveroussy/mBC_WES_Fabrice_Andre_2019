## Data access procedure

<br><br>
For access to either Github or EGA, you need to download all the documents on this github and send them back to us.
<br><br>



**Github access** 
1) Send a request to Fabrice ANDRE and Alicia TRAN DIEN with :

    a) your github username;

    b) all the documents signed;
    

2) Wait for a confirmation (this might takes a few weeks)

3) You can now have access to the private github via the link below:
https://github.com/gustaveroussy/mBC_WES_Fabrice_Andre_2019_private

**Please note** : if you do not follow this procedure, you will get a broken link with a 404 error while accessing to the private github 

<br><br>

**EGA** 

Data access decisions can be passed to the EGA in two ways:
1) By emailing helpdesk@ega-archive.org with the email address of each applicant and confirmation of the dataset/s to provide access. EGA will then create an EGA account with the relevant access permissions.

2) By using the EGA DAC Admin tools (available to DAC's dealing with more than 5 data access applications/month). Further information on the DAC admin tools and how to access them can be found here: https://ega-archive.org/submission/dac/tools


In addition, do not forget to send all the documents needed.
